# Express.js

Express.js is a web framework for Node.js. It does a lot of the heavy lifting and common tasks, like templates engine, fetching post data and handling errors. This way the developer(s) can focus on developing the core of the application.

## Getting started

Express can be installed via npm

```bash
npm install --save express
```

It can then be imported in `app.js` to be used:

```javascript
const http = require("http");
const express = require("express");

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);

server.listen(3000);
```

Running `npm start` will spin up the server, but it won't respond to any requests until routes are defined.

## Middleware

Express uses middleware to inspect and manipulate requests and responses as they come in or out. Middleware might have the function of authentication, routing, etc.

Middleware can be added using the `use()` function in the express variable (`app`). It needs to be added before `app` is passed to the `http.createServer()` function.

Middleware is defined as functions. Each funtion takes three parameters:

1. `req`: the request object;
2. `res`: the response object;
3. `next`: a function that calls the next middleware in the queue.

Middleware is chained, like an onion. The first function is the outer most layer of the onion, then the next one is the second layer, etc. This continues down all middleware functions. Each function can inspect of manipulate the incoming request and decide to send a response back or pass the request on to the next middleware (`next()`). In the latter case, the response returned by one of the subsequent middleware functions can again be altered before it bubbles up the the previous middleware.

```javascript
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("In the middleware");
    next();
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("In another middleware");
    res.send("<h1>Hello from Express!</h1>");
});

app.listen(3000); // Shortcut for const server = http.createServer(app) and server.listen(3000)
```

## Routes

Middleware functions can be given a route parameter to only add it to the middleware chain if the route starts with the given string. The order of the middleware matters here: a `/` matches all paths as they all start with a `/`. If that route returns a response instead of calling `next()`, no subsequent middleware will be executed.

```javascript
app.use("/add-product", (req, res, next) => {
    res.send("<h1>Add product page</h1>");
});

app.use("/", (req, res, next) => {
    res.send("<h1>Hello from Express!</h1>");
});
```

The example above returns a response with `<h1>Add product page</h1>` on all routes starting with `/add-product`. All other routes will return with `<h1>Hello from Express!</h1>`.

To define middleware that runs on every request, define it before any middleware returning a response, use a path of `/` and call `next()`:

```javascript
app.use("/", (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("This runs on every request");
    next();
});

app.use("/add-product", (req, res, next) => {
    res.send("<h1>Add product page</h1>");
});

app.use("/", (req, res, next) => {
    res.send("<h1>Hello from Express!</h1>");
});
```
