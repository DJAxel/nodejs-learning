# Debugging

## NPM

A project can be initiated as an npm (Node Package Manager) package to centralize dependencies and scripts. Furthermore, it can be distributed through npm to other developers.

To do so, run `npm init` in the root folder and answer the interactive prompts. The defaults are usually fine.

This generates the `package.json` file with metadata like the package name, the author, a description and a version number. Furthermore it defines scripts.

### Scripts

To make running the project easier, it is a good idea to define the `start` script. In the `scripts` object in `package.json`, a script names `"start"` (with double quotes) can be added, followed by a string containing the start-up command:

```json
{
    "name": "node_js",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "NodeJS code-along",
    "main": "src/app.js",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
        "start": "node src/app.js"
    }
}
```

This script can be executed with the `npm start` command, which is shorter than the previous `node src/app.js` command.

A script can have any name (without spaces), but `start` is special. All other scripts can be run using the `npm run SCRIPT_NAME` command (replacing `SCRIPT_NAME` with the name of the script). Omitting `run` in the command will result in an error.

## Hot reloading

In order to avoid the need to restart the node server after every change manually, nodemon can be installed and called instead of node.

To install this npm package, run `npm install nodemon --save-dev`. It will download it and its own dependencies to the `node_modules` folder and add it to the `devDependencies` in `package.json`.

To use nodemon, simply replace `node` in the startup command with `nodemon`. E.g. change the `start` script in `package.json` to `nodemon src/app.js`.
